# Momentum Screener Project Knowledge Base
*For Claude Code Assistant Reference*

## Project Overview
This is a real-time momentum trading alert system focused on **LONG TRADES ONLY** for small-cap stocks. The system continuously monitors TradingView screener data to detect bullish momentum patterns and sends optimized Telegram alerts.

## Key Components

### 1. Main Files
- **`volume_momentum_tracker.py`** - Core momentum tracking and alert system
- **`tradingview_screener_bot.py`** - TradingView data collection (small caps screener)
- **`paper_trading_system.py`** - NEW: Automated paper trading simulation
- **`market_sentiment_scorer.py`** - Market condition analysis
- **`end_of_day_analyzer.py`** - Post-market performance analysis
- **`alert_validator.py`** - Alert validation and pattern analysis

### 2. Data Storage
- **`momentum_data/`** - Alert files stored as JSON with timestamps
- **`momentum_data/paper_trades/`** - Paper trading data (trade history, active positions)
- **`volume_momentum_tracker.log`** - System logs
- Alert files format: `alerts_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`

## Alert System Architecture

### Alert Types (5 Categories)
1. **Price Spikes** (43% of alerts) - Significant positive price movements
2. **Premarket Price Alerts** (18.7%) - Pre-market price movements
3. **Volume Climbers** (14.1%) - Stocks climbing volume rankings
4. **Volume Newcomers** (13.3%) - New high-volume entries
5. **Premarket Volume Alerts** (10.8%) - Pre-market volume surges

### Alert Filtering System (Recently Enhanced)
**Momentum Scoring**: `(price_change × 0.4) + (rel_volume × 0.3) + (change_from_open × 0.3)`

**Priority Tiers**:
- **High Priority (>50)**: Immediate alerts, bypass cooldowns
- **Medium Priority (20-50)**: Standard processing  
- **Low Priority (<20)**: Extended cooldown periods

**Cooldown System**:
- High performers (>20% avg change): 5-minute cooldown
- Regular (5-20% avg change): 10-minute cooldown
- Poor performers (<5% avg change): 20-minute cooldown

## Key Thresholds & Parameters

### Current Settings (Post-Optimization)
- **Immediate Alert Threshold**: 15% (lowered from 25%)
- **Flat-to-Spike Threshold**: 12.1% change from open (lowered from 15%)
- **Flat Volatility Threshold**: 3% max volatility to consider "flat"
- **Minimum Flat Duration**: 8 minutes
- **Price Filter**: < $20 per share
- **Exchange Filter**: Excludes OTC

### Sector-Specific Tuning
```
Finance & Health Technology:
  - 1.5x relative volume multiplier (reduce noise)
Technology Services:
  - 0.9x multipliers (catch early momentum)
Electronic Technology:
  - 0.8x multipliers (prioritize high momentum)
Utilities:
  - 30% max ticker concentration (prevent PCG/PC dominance)
```

## Historical Performance Insights

### Top Pattern: Flat-to-Spike Detection
- **33.6% of alerts** show flat-to-spike patterns
- **47.21% average** change from open for flat-to-spike
- **High success rate** - prioritized in momentum scoring

### Common Issues (Addressed in Recent Updates)
1. **PCG/PC Over-Concentration**: 16.4% of all alerts from one ticker
   - *Solution*: Sector concentration limits
2. **Late Detection**: 25% threshold too high for early momentum
   - *Solution*: Lowered to 15%
3. **Sector Noise**: Finance/Health Tech generating false positives
   - *Solution*: Sector-specific multipliers

### Quality Metrics Benchmarks
- **83.6%** of alerts have >3x relative volume (excellent filtering)
- **44%** have >5% price moves (good capture rate)
- **26.6%** show flat-to-spike patterns (high success indicator)
- **3%** are massive moves (>25%) - suggests room for earlier detection

## Code Structure Deep Dive

### Key Classes
```python
class VolumeMomentumTracker:
    # Main tracker with enhanced filtering
    def should_send_alert() - NEW comprehensive filtering
    def calculate_momentum_score() - NEW scoring system
    def get_sector_adjusted_thresholds() - NEW sector tuning
```

### Alert Flow
1. **Data Collection** - TradingView screener every 2 minutes
2. **Pattern Detection** - Price spikes, flat-to-spike, volume changes
3. **Momentum Scoring** - Calculate composite score
4. **Filtering** - Apply cooldowns, sector adjustments, concentration limits
5. **Telegram Sending** - Rate-limited, markdown-formatted alerts
6. **Logging** - JSON files for analysis, performance tracking

### Data Schema
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO format",
  "volume_climbers": [],
  "volume_newcomers": [],
  "price_spikes": [
    {
      "ticker": "SYMBOL",
      "current_price": float,
      "change_pct": float,
      "volume": int,
      "relative_volume": float,
      "sector": "string",
      "alert_type": "flat_to_spike|price_spike",
      "flat_analysis": {},
      "change_from_open": float
    }
  ],
  "premarket_volume_alerts": [],
  "premarket_price_alerts": []
}
```

## Analysis & Performance Tracking

### Weekly Analysis Script
Created `telegram_alert_analyzer.py` for comprehensive performance analysis:
- Alert distribution by type and sector
- Top performing tickers and patterns
- Time-based activity patterns
- Success rate metrics
- Threshold optimization recommendations

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Alert-to-Move Conversion Rate** (track 1hr, 4hr, 1day post-alert)
2. **False Positive Rate** (alerts failing to sustain momentum)
3. **Sector Rotation Detection** (momentum shifts between sectors)
4. **Pattern Success Rate** (flat-to-spike vs regular spike performance)

## Market Context Understanding

### Current Market Characteristics
- **High Volatility**: 10.52% average price changes
- **Strong Volume Activity**: 83.6% alerts above 3x relative volume
- **Premarket Dominance**: 29.5% alerts in premarket (gap-play environment)
- **Technology Leadership**: Tech sectors showing consistent momentum

### Peak Activity Patterns
- **03:00-04:59**: Highest activity (premarket preparation)
- **22:00-23:59**: Secondary peak (after-hours momentum)
- **09:00-16:00**: Limited activity (missed intraday opportunities)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **No Telegram Alerts**: Check bot token, chat ID, cookie extraction
2. **Over-Concentration**: Review sector limits and cooldown periods
3. **Missing Momentum**: Check if thresholds are too high
4. **False Positives**: Verify sector-specific multipliers

### Log Analysis
- Check `volume_momentum_tracker.log` for system status
- Monitor JSON alert files for pattern changes
- Use analysis scripts for performance insights

## Recent Optimizations (Sep 2025)

### Implemented Changes
1. **Threshold Optimization**: 25% → 15% immediate alerts
2. **Momentum Scoring**: Composite scoring system
3. **Smart Cooldowns**: Performance-based cooldown periods
4. **Sector Tuning**: Custom multipliers per sector
5. **Concentration Limits**: Prevent ticker dominance
6. **Enhanced Flat-to-Spike**: 15% → 12.1% threshold
7. **NEW: Paper Trading System**: Automated strategy backtesting

### Expected Outcomes
- Earlier detection of significant moves
- Reduced noise from over-active tickers
- Better sector-specific filtering
- Improved flat-to-spike pattern capture
- Balanced alert distribution

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

## Important Notes for Claude

1. **Always check recent alert files** in `momentum_data/` for current performance
2. **Review logs** for system health and filtering effectiveness  
3. **The system is LONG TRADES ONLY** - only bullish momentum matters
4. **Flat-to-spike patterns are highest priority** - they have best success rates
5. **PCG/PC over-concentration was a major issue** - now addressed with limits
6. **Sector-specific tuning is critical** - Finance/Health Tech are noisy
7. **Analysis scripts provide actionable insights** - use them for optimization recommendations
8. **Paper trading system validates strategy effectiveness** - use it to test alert profitability
9. **EMA-based exits help manage risk** - 9 EMA entry, 25 EMA exit strategy implemented

This knowledge base should be updated whenever significant changes are made to the system architecture, performance insights are discovered, or optimization strategies are implemented.
